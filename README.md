# SwaggerAPI: Skeleton project
Tutorial to learn how to use swagger API framework

### How to start


First, run the swagger application locally using

```
swaggger project start -m
```

It will restart as soon as a file change is detected. Your application
is now reachable via http://localhost:10010/ or as defined in the swagger yaml file.


To adapt the swagger yaml file of this project, just use

```
swaggger project edit
```
to open the swagger editor at http://127.0.0.1:54218.
